## Food for All

### The University of Sheffield COM6103 Team Project

Globally, one in nine people are hungry or undernourished. In 2020, 2.37 billion people did not have access to
enough safe and nutritious food.    

Hunger is considereed the leading cause of death in the world. Our planet has provided us with tremendous
resources, but unequal access and inefficient handling leaves millions of people malnourished. It is said that
around 9 million people die every year of hunger and hunger-related diseases.


This project aims to attempt to resolve this problem by making it easy for people to donate a meal to individuals
who cannot afford one. This project involves the development of a web application that allows users to donate
the equivalent price of a meal in their local currency to projects/commumity intervnetions listed by charities on
the application.

### Feature list 
1. The application allow charities to register and log in
2. The application allow members of the public to donate (a meal or more) to the listed projects of their choice using either PayPal.
3. The application contain a dashboard where the staff of charities can see a snapshot and graph of relevant metrics-number of donations, number of meals, total donations and several others.
